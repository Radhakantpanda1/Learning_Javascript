switch case in JS

The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value against a series of case clauses, and executes statements after the first case clause with a matching value, until a break statement is encountered. The default clause of a switch statement will be jumped to if no case matches the expression's value.

Breaking and fall-through
You can use the break statement within a switch statement's body to break out early, often when all statements between two case clauses have been executed. Execution will continue at the first statement following switch.

If break is omitted, execution will proceed to the next case clause, even to the default clause, regardless of whether the value of that clause matches. This behavior is called "fall-through".

default case-
A default clause; if provided, this clause is executed if the value of expression doesn't match any of the case clauses. A switch statement can only have one default clause.
