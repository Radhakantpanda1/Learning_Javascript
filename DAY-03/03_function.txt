Function-

A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation, and produce output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call that function. 

syntax-
function functionName(Parameter1, Parameter2, ...)
{
    // Function body
}

function name(params) {
    
}


**************************************** ARROW FUNCTION ***********************************************
Arrow function-

It is one of the most used and efficient methods to create a function in JavaScript because of its comparatively easy implementation. It is a simplified as well as a more compact version of a regular or normal function expression or syntax.

syntax-
let function_name = (argument1, argument2 ,..) => expression

******************************** PARAMETERS ************************************************
Function Parameters: Parameters are additional information passed to a function. The parameters are passed to the function within parentheses after the function name and separated by commas. A function in JavaScript can have any number of parameters and also at the same time, a function in JavaScript can not have a single parameter.


************************************ cALLING FUNCTION ***************************************************

Calling Functions: After defining a function, the next step is to call them to make use of the function. We can call a function by using the function name separated by the value of parameters enclosed between the parenthesis and a semicolon at the end. The below syntax shows how to call functions in JavaScript:
functionName( Value1, Value2, ..);
