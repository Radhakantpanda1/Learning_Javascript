Some rules which we follow while writting code in JS is called syntax.

The variable of JS can be changed during runtime/ execution of programme
let userName="Radhakant";

These are memory spaces which is used to hold a value.


**************************** let const and var ********************************************
var is globally scoped while let and const are block scoped
var can be updated and re-declared
let can be updated but can't be redeclared
const can neither be redeclared nor be updated.

** const must be initialised during declaration **
